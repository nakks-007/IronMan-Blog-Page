        <p class="title"> The Iron Man & his Supremacy </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was
            co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don
            Heck
            and Jack Kirby.
            The character made his first appearance in Tales of Suspense #39 (cover dated March 1963), and received his
            own
            title in Iron Man #1 (May 1968).
            Also in 1963, the character founded the Avengers alongside Thor, Ant-Man, Wasp and the Hulk. <br />
            <br />
            A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, philanthropist, inventor and ingenious scientist, Anthony
            Edward
            Stark suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping. When his captors attempt to force him to build a
            weapon
            of mass destruction,
            he instead creates a mechanized suit of armor to save his life and escape captivity.
            Later, Stark develops his suit, adding weapons and other technological devices he designed through his
            company,
            Stark Industries. <br />
            <br />
            He uses the suit and successive versions to protect the world as Iron Man. Although at first concealing his
            true
            identity, Stark eventually publicly reveals himself to be Iron Man. <br />
            Initially, Iron Man was a vehicle for Stan Lee to explore Cold War themes, particularly the role of American
            technology and industry in the fight against communism.
            Subsequent re-imaginings of Iron Man have transitioned from Cold War motifs to contemporary matters of the
            time.

            “My name is Tony Stark and I'm not afraid of you. I know you're a coward, so I decided… that you just died,
            pal.
            I'm gonna come get the body. There's no politics here, it's just good old-fashioned revenge.”
